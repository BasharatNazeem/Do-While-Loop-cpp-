# Do-While-Loop-cpp-
This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates the use of the do-while loop. The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: the condition is evaluated after the block of code is executed. This ensures that the code inside the loop will always run at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
